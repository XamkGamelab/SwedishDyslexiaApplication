# Swedish Dyslexia Application
Xamk Game Studios Summer Internship project.

This project is a WebGL Unity 6 application (Unity 6000.1.1f1), built to help dyslexic students learn Swedish. The app itself will contain 3-4 minigames, each trying to aid the student with learning. The end goal of the application is to have a game built around these minigames, with fluid transition between each of them.

## Minigame #0
The first minigame will contain flash cards, aimed to teach new words to the student.

## Minigame #1
The second minigame will ask the player to translate Swedish words into Finnish.

## Minigame #2
The third minigame will ask the player to translate Finnish words into Swedish.

## Minigame #3
The fourth minigame will ask the player to conjugate a given Swedish word into a specific form, e.g. past tense.
